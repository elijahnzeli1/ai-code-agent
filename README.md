# AI Next.js Agent VS Code Extension

This VS Code extension provides an AI-powered assistant for creating and managing Next.js and React projects. It integrates with Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, and Radix UI to generate accessible and customizable components.

## Features

- Create new Next.js or React projects with a single command
- Generate custom components using AI
- Optimize existing code
- Automatic integration of Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, and Radix UI

## Getting Started

1. Install the extension from the VS Code Marketplace
2. Open a workspace where you want to create your project
3. Run the "Start AI Next.js Agent" command and enter your Gemini API key
4. Use the extension's commands to create projects and components

## Using Generated Components

The extension generates components using Tailwind CSS for styling and incorporates Radix UI primitives where applicable. Here's how you can customize and use these components:

1. Tailwind CSS: The generated components use Tailwind CSS classes. You can easily modify the styling by changing these classes or adding new ones.

2. shadcn/ui: The extension installs shadcn/ui, which provides a set of accessible and customizable components. You can use these components directly or as a reference for creating your own.

3. Radix UI: Some components may use Radix UI primitives for complex interactions. These primitives are highly customizable and accessible out of the box.

## Customizing Generated Components

To customize a generated component:

1. Open the component file (located in `src/components`)
2. Modify the Tailwind CSS classes to change the styling
3. Adjust the component's structure or logic as needed
4. If using Radix UI primitives, refer to their documentation for customization options

## Adding New Components

You can add new components using the "Add Component" command in the VS Code command palette. The AI will generate a new component based on your specifications, using Tailwind CSS and relevant Radix UI primitives.

## Optimizing Code

Use the "Optimize Code" command to improve the performance and readability of your existing code. The AI will refactor your code following React and TypeScript best practices.

## Feedback and Contributions

If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please open an issue on the GitHub repository. Contributions are welcome!
